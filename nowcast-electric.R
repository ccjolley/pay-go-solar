# How to do something similar for growth in electricity access? I'm not sure how
# dramatic growth has really been for these markets. Maybe assuming that the people most
# likely to gain electric access are those whose neighbors (within some distance) already
# had it? Seems consistent with gradual extention of electric grids.

# TODO: use DHS API to plot electricity adoption among all PA markets

# TODO: use WB indicator API to do the same thing

# TODO: best way to predict electricity access expansion? Lower wealth point (like mobiles?)
# Geographic?
